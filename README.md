I am maintaining this as a way to show my work through github as team treehouse uses an internal monitor for progress instead of commits.

## Treehouse README.md
Hello!

Your instructions are as follows:

### First Video Instructions

1) In the Library.js file, declare a Library class. Do not yet add a constructor method.
2) In the Book.js file, declare a Book class. Do not yet add a constructor method.
3) In the Patron.js file, declare a Patron class. Do not yet add a constructor method.

### Second Video Instructions

1) In the Library.js file, add a constructor method to the Library class. In the constructor method, initialize the following properties: books, patrons.

2) In the Book.js file, add a constructor method to the Book class. In the constructor method, initialize the following properties: title, author, isbn.

3) In the Patron.js file, add a constructor method to the Patron class. In the constructor method, initialize the following properties: name, email, currentBook.

Don't forget to add parameters for any values that need to be passed in to each of the constructor methods.

### Third Video Instructions

1) In the Library.js file, add two methods to the Library class: addPatron() and addBook()

- addPatron() receives one parameter, a patron object. This object (stored in the `patron` variable) should be added to the Library object's (stored in the`library` variable) `patrons` property, which is an array.

- addBook() receives one parameter, a book object. This object (stored in the `book` variable) should be added to the Library object's `books` property, which is an array.
